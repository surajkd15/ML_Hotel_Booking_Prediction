# ML_Hotel_Booking_Prediction
In this project, I have to predict whether a hotel booking will cancel or not.

I have tried to find things like:
1. No. of guests from different countries
2. Prices of different types of rooms per night
3. Months in which guests are high
4. How long do people stay at the hotel?

I have ran different models to check the which model will give maximum accuracy.
I have used Jupyter Notebook to calculate all these things.
